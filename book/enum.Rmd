# Enumerations

Like Rust, C++ has `enum`s. Unlike Rust, their `enum`s are much less powerful. C++'s enumeration
comes in two flavors: the plain, C-compatible `enum`, and the `enum class`. Generally, you should
always use an `enum class`, but you should also learn about the plain `enum` in order to read
others' code.

## The Plain `enum`

### Defining an Enum

The syntax for defining an `enum` in C++ is similar to Rust. In addition, like in Rust, enum
variants are represented as integers at the low level, and by default the value starts from 0.

```c++
enum LogLevel
{
    Debug,   // 0
    Info,    // 1
    Warning, // 2
    Error    // 3
};
```

You can also manually assign values to the variants (also valid in Rust):

```c++
enum LogLevel
{
    Debug   = 0x12,
    Info    = 0xd1,
    Warning = 0x7c,
    Error   = 0x0a,
};
```

Unlike Rust, C++ by default uses the `int` type to represent the variants, even though most of the
time the number of variants won't exceed 256. To use a more compact representation, you can do:

```c++
enum MyEnum : uint8_t
// or `enum Foo : char` (remember that `char` is an integer type)
{
    Foo,
    Bar,
};
```

### Using an Enum

Unlike Rust, a C++ `enum` does not create a namespace, which means you cannot write `LogLevel::Info`
to refer to the `Info` variant of the `LogLevel` enum defined in the prevous subsection. You should
write `Info` directly.

A enum is implicitly converted to an integer. Which means it can be directly compared to an integer
(but dont't actually do this) and can be pushed to `std::cout` directly.

```c++
LogLevel lvl = Info;
assert(Info == 1);
assert(Warning > 1);
assert(Error > Debug);
std::cout << lvl << std::endl;
```

However, an integer cannot be converted implicitly into an enum, but can be done so explicitly:

```c++
LogLevel lvl = 2;           // won't work
LogLevel lvl = (LogLevel)2; // OK, but don't actually do this
```

You can reassign the identifier `Info` to another value

```c++
int Info = 999;
```

...but can you set another `LogLevel` to `Info`?

```c++
LogLevel m = Info; // Error!
```

No you can't. C++ generally forbids re-defining variables, but in the case of
enums you are allowed to re-bind a enum variant identifier (`Info`) to another
value (`999`), then you just can't use that enum variant.

To avoid this and other kinds of conflicts, it had been a common practice to
enum variants with part of the enum name. For example, the `LogLevel` enum
may be rewritten as:

```c++
enum LogLevel
{
    LevelDebug,
    LevelInfo,
    LevelWarning,
    LevelError
};
```


...which violates the DRY rule in a bad way. To solve this problem, `enum class` was introduced
in C++11, and we'll learn about it in the next section.
