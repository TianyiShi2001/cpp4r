Since the decision was made in April 2020, I naturally chose Rust. Soon I fell in love with it. Cargo, rustdoc, crates.io, clippy etc. just makes Rust so nice–even better than Python. However, I have to face the reality: the majority of bioinformatics algorithms to date are written in C or C++ (either as pure C or C++ libraries or as extensions to Python or R), and most labs are still developing on them. It turns out that some C and C++ literacy is necessary for me. While there is a project called r4cppp that introduces Rust to C++ programmers, I haven’t found any cpp4r, so I started this one. I’m not an expert in Rust and C++ and I’m writing this book while learning them, so it’ll be more like a personal notebook than a perfessional guide. I’ll try to make it readable, though.

"],["hello-world.html", "1.1 Hello world", " 1.1 Hello world This is a hello world program in C++: #include &lt;iostream&gt; int main() { std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Hello C++!&quot; &lt;&lt; std::endl; return 0; } Write the above code in hello.cpp, then you can compile it with g++ hello.cpp -o hello and run ./hello (you can replace g++ with clang++ or any other compiler). A couple of things to note here: Every C++ executable (as opposed to library) must have a main() function that returns int. Returning 0 signifies that the program terminates without errors. The final return 0; statement can be omitted in the main() function. #include is a preprocessor. We’ll meet more preprocessors in the future, for now just accept that they are “naive macros” that are “expanded” before the actual compilation. Here #include copies the content of file called iostream, which has tens of thousands lines, and pastes it here. Yes, it literally does so, and you can check this by running g++ -E main.c, which “expands” all preprocessor statements. iostream contains definitions of functions and objects such as std::cout and std::endl, which are used for IO manipulations. cout stands for “character output,” and endl stands for “endline” (it appends \\n and flushes the buffer). &lt;&lt; is the bitwise left shift operator, and the designers of C++ decided that overloading bitwise shift operators for cout and cin can make C++ look fancy from the beginning. That’s why we need to learn yet another special syntax. iostream also introduces another function into scope, the C-compatible printf into scope, which can also be used to print “Hello world.” printf(&quot;Hello from printf\\n&quot;); Since we do not have string interpolation of variable in this case, we can also use puts: puts(&quot;Hello from printf&quot;); // newline automatically appended Now you might begin to wonder, why isn’t std::cout called std::iostream::cout, and why printf can be called without any prefix. This is because in C++ filenames have no relationships to namespaces by default. namespace is similar to Rust’s mod, but more flexible. In this case, the iostream file contains something conceptually like this: void printf(...); namespace std { class cout {} class endl {} } printf isn’t placed inside std because it is a heritage from C. Many other C functions are also available in C++, and they can be distinguished by the absence of the std:: prefix.

While the relationships described in the table are always true, C++’s integer types are much more complex. The types above are fixed width integer types, and there are additional integer types whose width is dependent on the implementation. These include C-compatible ones (i.e. char, short, int, long, long long), and other C++ artifects such as int_fast16_t and int_least32_t.

"],["variables.html", "1.3 Variables", " 1.3 Variables Like in Rust, creating a variable requires two steps, declaration and initialization. The traditional syntax for declaration and initialization is &lt;type&gt; &lt;var name&gt; = &lt;value&gt;;, and these two steps can be separated: int a = 5; char b; b = &#39;A&#39;; The above syntax is compatible with C, which has a problem: if you initialize an int with a float: int a = 5.5; assert(a == 5); The value will be implicitly converted (recent compilers will give a warning when this happens; see Figure 1.1). C++11 introduced the “uniform initialization” syntax, which forbids this implicit conversion. In its simplest form: int a{5}; Figure 1.1: When implicit conversion occurs, a decent modern C++ compiler will give a warning. If you try int a{5.5}; with this syntax, the compiler will give an error and abort (Figure 1.2 ). In addition, you can’t separate the two parts: // not allowed int a; a{5} Figure 1.2: The uniform initialization syntax. Of course, the uniform initialization syntax isn’t invented just to prevent implicit conversion. As you’ll see later, it can become handy when initializing complicated, non-primitive data types. 1.3.1 Mutability Variables are mutable by default. If you want to create an immutable variable, use the const keyword. // Rust let a = 5; let mut b = 10; is equivalent to //C++ const auto a = 5; auto b = 10; If const is used to create an immutable variable, how to create a real “constant” that’s evaluated at compile time? The answer is consexpr. // Rust const LIGHT_SPEED: f64 = 2.99792458e8; is equivalent to constexpr double LIGHT_SPEED = 2.99792458e8; What about constant strings? Well, like Rust, you can’t use the dynamically allocated std::string. // Rust const NAME: String = &quot;Hideyo&quot;.to_string(); // not allowed! const NAME: &amp;&#39;static str = &quot;Hideyo&quot;; // good //C++ constexpr std::string NAME = &quot;Hideyo&quot;; // not allowed! constexpr char NAME[] = &quot;Hideyo&quot;; // good So you have to use an array of characters. Well, it’s technically closer to const NAME: &amp;[u8] = b\"Hideyo\";. Then, if you need to use the std::string, you need explicit conversion: #include &lt;iostream&gt; constexpr char NAME[] = &quot;Hideyo&quot;; constexpr char NAME_UTF8[] = &quot;英世&quot;; int main() { const std::string NAME_STRING(NAME); const std::string NAME_UTF8_STRING(NAME_UTF8); // thank god UTF8 works! If you were in C you would have a hard time. std::cout &lt;&lt; NAME_UTF8_STRING &lt;&lt; &quot; &quot; &lt;&lt; NAME_STRING &lt;&lt; std::endl; } "],["functions.html", "1.4 Functions", " 1.4 Functions Functions are declared and defined in the following way: &lt;return_type&gt; &lt;function_name&gt;(&lt;params&gt;) { // do something return something; } For example: #include &lt;iostream&gt; float square(float a) { return a * a; } int main() { float x = 2.5; std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;square of &quot; &lt;&lt; x &lt;&lt; &quot;is&quot; &lt;&lt; square(x) &lt;&lt; std::endl; } Note that a function must be declared before it can be used. This means the following won’t work: #include &lt;iostream&gt; // float square(float); int main() { float x = 2.5; std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;square of &quot; &lt;&lt; x &lt;&lt; &quot;is&quot; &lt;&lt; square(x) &lt;&lt; std::endl; } float square(float a) { return a * a; } However, by uncommenting the third line, it works. When you use a function, the compiler must know the signature, but not necessarily the definition of the function. This is why in C++ (and in C) people split their funtions into signatures which go into header files, and definitions which go into .cpp files. I’ll get back to header files later. For now we’ll be working with single-file programs without splitting declaration and definitions. "],["pointers-and-references.html", "1.5 Pointers and References", " 1.5 Pointers and References Let’s revisit how we make references and pointers in Rust: In Rust, when you take a reference to a type T, the type of the reference is &amp;T. Basically, you add &amp; to both LHS and RHS: // type annotations are not required; this is just for demonstration let a: i32 = 5; let r_a: &amp;i32 = &amp;a; // r_a == &amp;5 and when you deference, you use *. Just remember that * is the reverse of &amp;, and every * removes one &amp; from both LHS and RHS: let r_a: &amp;i32 = &amp;5; let a: i32 = *r_a; // a == 5 let a: i32 = *&amp;*&amp;*&amp;a You can coerce a reference into a raw pointer, using either of the two syntaxes: let a = 5; let p_a: *const i32 = &amp;a; // or let p_a = &amp;a as *const i32; You need to be explicit about mutability: let a = 5; let p_a: *mut i32 = &amp;mut a; // or let p_a = &amp;mut a as *mut i32; In C++, the difference between a reference and pointer is smaller. Pointers are compatible with C, and references are a C++-only thing. In C++ (and C), this is how you make a pointer: int a = 5; int *p_a = &amp;a; // or int * p_a = &amp;a; // or int* p_a = &amp;a; You add &amp; to RHS, but you add * to LHS. Despite the fact that the variable name really is p_a, not *p_a, and the type really is int*, many people and formatters prepend the asterisk before the variable name (int *p_a = &amp;a;). There are some discussion at StackOverflow on why people are preferring this style. I personally prefer using the int* p_a = &amp;a style, which is also being used consistently on cppreference, and in Bjarne Stroustrup’s A Tour of C++. Anyway, you can choose whichever form you like when you write your code, but you need to able to read all forms so that you can read others’ code. Note that, unlike in Rust, you cannot create a pointer to a literal in C++: int* p = &amp;5; // not allowed! The reason is that, 5 is an “rvalue,” which is “temporary” and thus it’s impossible to take its memory address with &amp;. To dereference a pointer, you use the dereference operator, *, which has the same semantics as Rust. int b = *p_a; References have similar capabilities as pointers, with the only big difference being their semantics. This is how you create a reference and read its referent’s value: int l = 5; int&amp; m = l; assert(m == 5); // not `*m` ! You do not need to (and cannot) use the deference operator (*) on a reference to access the value of the referent. In addition, a reference cannot be re-assigned to refer to another value. Apart from these two rules, references are effectively the same as pointers. It can be helpful to see a reference as an alias to a named variable. Indeed, a reference shares the same memory address as its referent. You can’t create a non-const reference to a literal, but you can create a const one: int&amp; r = 5; // not allowed const int&amp; r = 5; // ok Since we are Rustaceans, we are sensitive to mutability. Are there any difference between pointers and references in terms of mutability? The answer is no. Both can be used to mutate the referent. #include &lt;iostream&gt; int main() { int a{5}; int &amp;r_a = a; // create a reference int *p_a = &amp;a; // create a pointer puts(&quot;| a|r_a|*p_a| p_a |&quot;); a = 10; // mutate the value printf(&quot;|%d| %d| %d|%p|\\n&quot;, a, r_a, *p_a, p_a); r_a = 15; // mutate via reference; no asterisk! printf(&quot;|%d| %d| %d|%p|\\n&quot;, a, r_a, *p_a, p_a); *p_a = 20; // mutate via pointer printf(&quot;|%d| %d| %d|%p|\\n&quot;, a, r_a, *p_a, p_a); } | a|r_a|*p_a| p_a | |10| 10| 10|0x7ffe09e40404| |15| 15| 15|0x7ffe09e40404| |20| 20| 20|0x7ffe09e40404| I think it would be helpful to make a line-by-line comparison of some common tasks in Rust and in C++: 1.5.0.1 Reading The Value Without Mutation with A Pointer or Reference step C++ (pointer) C++ (reference) Rust Rust (raw pointer) init referent const int a = 5 const int a = 5 let a = 5 let a = 5 make ptr/ref const int* p = &amp;a const int&amp; r = a let r: &amp;i32 = &amp;a let p: *const i32 = &amp;a; read referent value *p r *r *p 1.5.0.2 Mutating the Value of the Referent with A Pointer or Reference step C++ (pointer) C++ (reference) Rust Rust (raw pointer) init referent int a = 5 int a = 5 let mut a = 5 let mut a = 5 make ptr/ref int* p = &amp;a int* r = &amp;a let r: &amp;mut i32 = &amp;mut a let p: *mut i32 = &amp;mut a; mutate *p = 10 r = 10 *r = 10 *p = 10 1.5.1 lvalues, rvalues, and rvalue references https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Rvalue_references "],["control-flow.html", "1.6 Control Flow", " 1.6 Control Flow C++ offers 5 types of control flow statements. if...else, for loop and while loop are pretty much the same as in Rust, but the switch statement is much less powerful than Rust’s match. Additionally there is a goto statement which performs unconditional jump. If you have experience in Javascript or Java, most of C++’s control flow syntax will be familiar to you. The conditional test associated with if, for, while and switch must be surrounded by parentheses. 1.6.1 if...else Like Rust, C++ offers if and else keywords to work with conditionals. Unlike Rust, C++ is not expression-oriented, so you cannot write: int a = if (true) { 5 } else { 10 }; But this kind of conditional assignment is a very common pattern, so C++ invented yet another syntax specifically designed for this single task: the ternary operator. So, instead of writing: int a; if (true) { a = 5; } else { a = 10; }; you could write: int a = true ? 5 : 10; The braces around the statement after the condition of if can be omitted if the statement can be written in a single line. For example: if (i &gt; 5) { std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;i is greater than 5&quot; &lt;&lt; std::endl; } can be reduced to: if (i &gt; 5) std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;i is greater than 5&quot; &lt;&lt; std::endl; 1.6.2 while Loop The while loop in C++ has nothing different from Rust, just remember to wrap the test expression with parentheses. #include &lt;iostream&gt; int i = 10; while (i &gt; 0) { i--; if (i == 8) { continue; } if (i == 5) { break; } std::cout &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; std::endl; } 1.6.3 for Loop A traditional C-style for loop looks like this: for (&lt;initializationStatement&gt;; &lt;testExpression&gt;; &lt;updateStatement&gt;) { // do something } For example: #include &lt;iostream&gt; puts(&quot;|i|j|&quot;); for (int i = 0; i &lt; 2; i++) { for (int j = 0; j &lt; 3; j++) { printf(&quot;|%d|%d|\\n&quot;, i, j); } } C++11 introduced the range-based for statement, which is also known as a for...in loop in most other languages (Rust, Swift, Python, Ruby, …). The syntax itself is easy but knowing the relationship between the element and the iterable can be tricky. Fortuantely, we are Rustaceans, so an easy way for me to illustrate and for you to understand is to write a few equivalent examples in Rust and C++. 1.6.3.1 Scenario 1: Copying (Cloning) // Rust let v = vec![&quot;a&quot;.to_string(), &quot;b&quot;.to_string(), &quot;c&quot;.to_string()]; for e.clone() in &amp;v { println!(&quot;{}&quot;, e); } // C++ #include &lt;iostream&gt; #include &lt;vector&gt; std::vector&lt;std::string&gt; a{&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;}; for (auto s : a) // s has type `std::string` { std::cout &lt;&lt; s &lt;&lt; std::endl; } Note how Rust makes it crystal clear that copying during iteration and using String for instead of &amp;str for static strings are anti-patterns and how C++ makes it easy to write such inefficient code. 1.6.3.2 Scenario 2: As Reference (Borrowing) // Rust let v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; for e in &amp;v { println!(&quot;{}&quot;, *e); } // C++ #include &lt;iostream&gt; #include &lt;vector&gt; std::vector&lt;int&gt; a{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; for (auto&amp; num : a) { printf(&quot;%d &quot;, num); // no asterisk! } 1.6.3.3 Scenario 3: Mutation // Rust let mut v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; for e in &amp;mut v { *e = *e + 1; } assert_eq!(v, vec![2, 3, 4, 5, 6]); // C++ #include &lt;vector&gt; #include &lt;cassert&gt; std::vector&lt;int&gt; a{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; for (auto &amp;num : a) { num++; } assert(a == (std::vector&lt;int&gt;{2, 3, 4, 5, 6})); Note the parentheses surrounding the second argument of assert, without which we would get an error. This is because assert is a so called #define macro, which simply parses its arguments as comma-separated identifiers and does text replacement. Since std::vector&lt;int&gt;{2, 3, 4, 5, 6} contains commas, it has to be escaped with parentheses.1 This macro is actually defined in assert.h which is part of C’s std, and its more or less copied verbatim into C++’s cassert. 1.6.4 goto Statement and Breaking outer Loops Rust, like Java and Python, allows you to break an outer loop from an inner loop: for i in 0..3 { &#39;for_j: for j in 0..3 { for k in 0..3 { if i == 1 { break &#39;for_j; } println!(&quot;{} {} {}&quot;, i, j, k); } } } C++ doesn’t support this natively, so it’s common to use the goto trick to achive this2. #include &lt;iostream&gt; void break_outer() { puts(&quot;Break outer loop using goto:&quot;); puts(&quot;i j k&quot;); for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; ++i) { for (int j = 0; j &lt; 3; ++j) { for (int k = 0; k &lt; 3; ++k) { if (i == 1) { goto for_j_end; } printf(&quot;%d %d %d\\n&quot;, i, j, k); } } for_j_end: { // cannot be left blank. Needs a placeholder } } } The goto statement must be in the same function as the label it is referring, so duplicated labels across different functions won’t cause conflicts. Alternatively you can use a flag, which is more verbose, and I think this is even less readable: puts(&quot;Break outer loop using flag:&quot;); puts(&quot;i j k&quot;); bool i_is_1{false}; for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; ++i) { for (int j = 0; j &lt; 3; ++j) { for (int k = 0; k &lt; 3; ++k) { if (i == 1) { i_is_1 = true; break; } else { i_is_1 = false; } printf(&quot;%d %d %d\\n&quot;, i, j, k); } if (i_is_1) { break; } } } There is another cleaner way, using the lambda trick (less common than the goto approach): puts(&quot;Break outer loop using lambda:&quot;); puts(&quot;i j k&quot;); for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; ++i) { [&amp;] { for (int j = 0; j &lt; 3; ++j) { for (int k = 0; k &lt; 3; ++k) { if (i == 1) { return; } printf(&quot;%d %d %d\\n&quot;, i, j, k); } } }(); } I’ll get back to lamdas later. For now just accept that they are roughly equivalent to Rust’s closures. 1.6.5 switch C++’s switch is essentially a shortcut for a series of if...else if...else if...else statements when you want to match the value a single expression to a range of constant values. For example: The following C++ code int d = 5; if (d == 0) { puts(&quot;It&#39;s Sunday!&quot;); } else if (d == 6) { puts(&quot;It&#39;s Saturday!&quot;); } else { puts(&quot;It&#39;s weekday.&quot;); } is equivalent to: switch (d) { case 0: puts(&quot;It&#39;s Sunday!&quot;); break; case 6: puts(&quot;It&#39;s Saturday!&quot;); break; default: puts(&quot;It&#39;s weekday.&quot;); break; } (I’ll start to omit headers from now on.) Note the break statement at the end of each case, without which the default branch will always be triggered, which is clearly not we mean to do3. You can group several values into a single branch: int d = 5; switch (d) { case 0: puts(&quot;It&#39;s Sunday!&quot;); break; case 6: puts(&quot;It&#39;s Saturday!&quot;); break; case 1: case 2: case 3: case 4: case 5: puts(&quot;It&#39;s weekday.&quot;); break; default: puts(&quot;Not a valid day of week!&quot;); break; } This is all about switch in C++.

C++‘s enumeration comes in two flavors: the plain, C-compatible enum, and the enum class. Generally, you should always use an enum class, but you should also learn about the plain enum in order to read others’ code. "],["the-plain-enum.html", "2.1 The Plain enum", " 2.1 The Plain enum 2.1.1 Defining an Enum The syntax for defining an enum in C++ is similar to Rust. In addition, like in Rust, enum variants are represented as integers at the low level, and by default the value starts from 0. enum LogLevel { Debug, // 0 Info, // 1 Warning, // 2 Error // 3 }; You can also manually assign values to the variants (also valid in Rust): enum LogLevel { Debug = 0x12, Info = 0xd1, Warning = 0x7c, Error = 0x0a, }; Unlike Rust, C++ by default uses the int type to represent the variants, even though most of the time the number of variants won’t exceed 256. To use a more compact representation, you can do: enum MyEnum : uint8_t // or `enum Foo : char` (remember that `char` is an integer type) { Foo, Bar, }; 2.1.2 Using an Enum Unlike Rust, a C++ enum does not create a namespace, which means you cannot write LogLevel::Info to refer to the Info variant of the LogLevel enum defined in the prevous subsection. You should write Info directly. A enum is implicitly converted to an integer. Which means it can be directly compared to an integer (but dont’t actually do this) and can be pushed to std::cout directly. LogLevel lvl = Info; assert(Info == 1); assert(Warning &gt; 1); assert(Error &gt; Debug); std::cout &lt;&lt; lvl &lt;&lt; std::endl; However, an integer cannot be converted implicitly into an enum, but can be done so explicitly: LogLevel lvl = 2; // won&#39;t work LogLevel lvl = (LogLevel)2; // OK, but don&#39;t actually do this You can reassign the identifier Info to another value int Info = 999; …but can you set another LogLevel to Info? LogLevel m = Info; // Error! No you can’t. C++ generally forbids re-defining variables, but in the case of enums you are allowed to re-bind a enum variant identifier (Info) to another value (999), then you just can’t use that enum variant. To avoid this and other kinds of conflicts, it had been a common practice to enum variants with part of the enum name. For example, the LogLevel enum may be rewritten as: enum LogLevel { LevelDebug, LevelInfo, LevelWarning, LevelError }; …which violates the DRY rule in a bad way. To solve this problem, enum class was introduced in C++11, and we’ll learn about it in the next section. "]]
