"],["about-this-book.html", "About this Book", " About this Book I’m a biochemistry student wishing to specialize in computational biology, and I need a fast (specifically, no-GC) language for implementing algorithms. Since the decision was made in April 2020, I naturally chose Rust. Soon I fell in love with it. Cargo, rustdoc, crates.io, clippy etc. just makes Rust so nice–even better than Python. However, I have to face the reality: the majority of bioinformatics algorithms to date are written in C or C++ (either as pure C or C++ libraries or as extensions to Python or R), and most labs are still developing on them. It turns out that some C and C++ literacy is necessary for me. While there is a project called r4cppp that introduces Rust to C++ programmers, I haven’t found any cpp4r, so I started this one. I’m not an expert in Rust and C++ and I’m writing this book while learning them, so it’ll be more like a personal notebook than a perfessional guide. I’ll try to make it readable, though. "],["prerequisites.html", "Prerequisites", " Prerequisites You’ll need a C++ compiler. I recommend using clang++ on Linux &amp; MacOS because it generally gives better error message than g++. On Windows you should use msvc. "],["hello-c.html", "Chapter 1 Hello C++ ", " Chapter 1 Hello C++ "],["hello-world.html", "1.1 Hello world", " 1.1 Hello world This is a hello world program in C++: #include &lt;iostream&gt; int main() { std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Hello C++!&quot; &lt;&lt; std::endl; return 0; } Write the above code in hello.cpp, then you can compile it with g++ hello.cpp -o hello and run ./hello (you can replace g++ with clang++ or any other compiler). A couple of thing to note here: Every C++ executable (as opposed to library) must have a main() function that returns int. Returning 0 signifies that the program terminates without errors. The final return 0; statement can be omitted in the main() function. #include is a preprocessor. We’ll meet more preprocessors in the future, for now just accept that they are “naive macros” that are “expanded” before the actual compilation. Here #include copies the content of file called iostream, which has tens of thousands lines, and pastes it here. Yes, it literally does so, and you can check this by running g++ -E main.c, which “expands” all preprocessor statements. iostream contains definitions of functions and objects such as std::cout and std::endl, which are used for IO manipulations. cout stands for “character output,” and endl stands for “endline” (it appends \\n and flushes the buffer). &lt;&lt; is the bitwise left shift operator, and the designers of C++ decided that overloading bitwise shift operators for cout and cin can make C++ look fancy from the beginning. That’s why we need to learn yet another special syntax. Fortunately (or unfortunately), there’s another way to do exactly the same thing: printf(&quot;Hello from printf\\n&quot;); Now you might begin to wonder, why isn’t std::cout called std::iostream::cout, and why printf can be called without any prefix. This is because in C++ filenames have no relationships to namespaces by default. namespace is similar to Rust’s mod, but more flexible. In this case, the iostream file contains something conceptually like this: void printf(...); namespace std { class cout {} class endl {} } printf isn’t placed inside std because it is a heritage from C. Many other C functions are also available in C++, and they can be distinguished by the absence of the std:: prefix. "],["hello-data-types-and-variables.html", "1.2 Hello Data Types and Variables", " 1.2 Hello Data Types and Variables The following table summarises the relationship between Rust’s and C++’s integer data types: Rust C++ C &amp; C++ i8 int8_t char i16 int16_t short i32 int32_t int i64 int64_t long i128 u8 uint8_t unsigned char u16 uint16_t unsigned short u32 uint32_t unsigned int u64 uint64_t unsigned long u128 isize usize size_t While the equivalence between the first column and the second column always holds true, the third column depends on the platform and here I’m assuming you’re on a modern, 64-bit system. While the relationships described in the table are always true, C++’s integer types are much more complex. The types above are fixed width integer types, and there are additional integer types whose width is dependent on the implementation. These include C-compatible ones (i.e. char, short, int, long, long long), and other C++ artifects such as int_fast16_t and int_least32_t. You can learn about them at cppreference. For floating numbers, f32 and f64 correspond to float and double, respectively (stand for single-precision and double-precision floating point numbers). Like in Rust, creating a variable requires two steps, declaration and initialization. In C++, there are usually more than one syntax to do any task, and these two basic operations are no exception. The traditional syntax for declaration and initialization is &lt;type&gt; &lt;var name&gt; = &lt;value&gt;;, and these two steps can be separated: int a = 5; char b; b = &#39;A&#39;; The above syntax is compatible with C, which has a problem: if you initialize an int with a float: int a = 5.5; assert(a == 5); The value will be implicitly converted. Instead of giving a warning or simply disallowing this (recent compilers DO give a warning; see Figure 1.1), the designers of C++ decided to invent another syntax for declaration and initialization, using curly braces: int a{5}; Figure 1.1: When implicit conversion occurs, a decent modern C++ compiler will give a warning. If you try int a{5.5}; with this syntax, the compiler will give an error and abort (Figure 1.2 ). In addition, you can’t separate the two parts: // not allowed int a; a{5} Figure 1.2: When implicit conversion occurs, a decent modern C++ compiler will give a warning. "],["pointers-and-references.html", "1.3 Pointers and References", " 1.3 Pointers and References Syntaxes related to pointers and references in C++ are…interesing. In rust, when you take a reference to a type T, the type of the reference is &amp;T. The syntax can’t be more natual: you add &amp; to both LHS and RHS: let a: i32 = 5; let p_a: &amp;i32 = &amp;5; // type annotations are not required; this is just for demonstration and when you deference, you use *. Just remembering that * is the reverse of &amp;, everything is natual as well. Every * just removes one &amp; from both LHS and RHS: let p_a: &amp;i32 = &amp;5; let a: i32 = *p_a; let a: i32 = *&amp;*&amp;*&amp;a In C++, this is what you would do to make a pointer: int a = 5; int *p_a = &amp;5; // or int * p_a = &amp;5; // or int* p_a = &amp;5; and to dereference a pointer: int b = *p_a; You add &amp; to RHS, but you add * to LHS. Weird. What’s worse, despite the fact that the variable name really is p_a, not *p_a, and the type really is int*, most people and formatters prepend the asterisk before the variable name, which looks like you’re declaring an int which is clearly not true. So why are people doing that? There are some discussion on StackOverflow. But wait, how did people learn this weird convention in the first place? On cppreference, and in Bjarne Stroustrup’s A Tour of C++, the int* p_a = &amp;5 style is always used, so just…why? Why are people sticking to the anti-standard? Since pointers are a heritage from C, it is not surprising that the creative C++ designers invented yet another similar syntax for achieving almost the same task: references. You create and read a reference like this: int l = 5; int &amp;m = l; assert(m == 5); // not `*m` ! Note that you do not (and cannot) use the deference operator (*) on a reference. In addition, a reference cannot be re-assigned to point to another value. Apart from these two rules, references are effectively the same as pointers. Since we are Rustaceans, we are sensitive to mutability. Are there any difference between pointers and references in terms of mutability? The answer is no. Both can be use to mutate the referent. #include &lt;iostream&gt; int main() { int a{5}; int &amp;r_a = a; // create a reference int *p_a = &amp;a; // create a pointer printf(&quot;| a|r_a|*p_a| p_a |\\n&quot;); a = 10; // mutate the value printf(&quot;|%d| %d| %d|%p|\\n&quot;, a, r_a, *p_a, p_a); r_a = 15; // mutate via reference; no asterisk! printf(&quot;|%d| %d| %d|%p|\\n&quot;, a, r_a, *p_a, p_a); *p_a = 20; // mutate via pointer printf(&quot;|%d| %d| %d|%p|\\n&quot;, a, r_a, *p_a, p_a); } | a|r_a|*p_a| p_a | |10| 10| 10|0x7ffe09e40404| |15| 15| 15|0x7ffe09e40404| |20| 20| 20|0x7ffe09e40404| "],["control-flow.html", "1.4 Control Flow", " 1.4 Control Flow C++ offers 5 types of control flow statements. if...else, for loop and while loop are pretty much the same as in Rust, but the switch statement is much less powerful than Rust’s match. Additionally there is a goto statement which performs unconditional jump and is notorious for leading to “unmaintainable spaghetti code” (however, people are still using them, and you’ll see why in a minute). If you have experience in Javascript or Java, most of C++’s control flow syntax will be familiar to you. The conditional test associated with if, for, while and switch must be surrounded by parentheses. 1.4.1 if...else Like Rust, C++ offers if and else keywords to work with conditionals. Unlike Rust, C++ is not expression-oriented, so you cannot write: int a = if (true) { 5 } else { 10 }; But this kind of conditional assignment is a very common pattern, so C++ invented yet another syntax specifically designed for this single task: the ternary operator. So, instead of writing: int a; if (true) { a = 5; } else { a = 10; }; you could write: int a = true ? 5 : 10; 1.4.2 while Loop The while loop in C++ has nothing different from Rust, just remember to wrap the test expression with parentheses. int i = 10; while (i &gt; 0) { if (i == 8) { continue; } if (i == 5) { break; } i--; } 1.4.3 for Loop A traditional C-style for loop looks like this (you’ll be familiar with this if you code Javascript or Java): for (&lt;initializationStatement&gt;; &lt;testExpression&gt;; &lt;updateStatement&gt;) { // do something } For example: #include &lt;iostream&gt; printf(&quot;|i|j|\\n&quot;); for (int i = 0; i &lt; 2; i++) { for (int j = 0; j &lt; 3; j++) { printf(&quot;|%d|%d|&quot;, i, j); } } C++11 introduced the range-based for statement, which is also known as a for...in loop in most other languages (Rust, Swift, Python, Ruby, …). The syntax itself is easy but knowing the relationship between the element and the iterable can be tricky. Fortuantely, we are Rustaceans, so an easy way for me to illustrate and for you to understand is to write a few equivalent examples in Rust and C++. 1.4.3.1 Scenario 1: As Reference (Borrowing) // Rust let v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; for e in &amp;v { println!(&quot;{}&quot;, *e); } // C++ #include &lt;iostream&gt; #include &lt;vector&gt; std::vector&lt;int&gt; a{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; for (auto&amp; num : a) { printf(&quot;%d &quot;, num); // no asterisk! } 1.4.3.2 Scenario 2: Mutation // Rust let mut v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; for e in &amp;mut v { *e = e + 1; } assert_eq!(v, vec![2, 3, 4, 5, 6]); // C++ #include &lt;vector&gt; #include &lt;cassert&gt; std::vector&lt;int&gt; a{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; for (auto &amp;num : a) { num++; } assert(a == (std::vector&lt;int&gt;{2, 3, 4, 5, 6})); Note the parentheses surrounding the second argument of assert, without which we would get an error. This is because assert is a so called #define macro, which simply parses its arguments as comma-separated identifiers and does text replacement. Since std::vector&lt;int&gt;{2, 3, 4, 5, 6} contains commas, it has to be escaped with parentheses.1 This macro is actually defined in assert.h which is part of C’s std, and its more or less copied verbatim into C++’s cassert. Theoretically I think it is possible to implement C++’s own assert or #define that removes the need for adding parentheses here and there. However, the C++ committee never cares about ergonomics. 1.4.3.3 Scenario 3: Copying (Cloning) let v = vec![&quot;a&quot;.to_string(), &quot;b&quot;.to_string(), &quot;c&quot;.to_string()]; for e.clone() in &amp;v { println!(&quot;{}&quot;, e); } // C++ #include &lt;iostream&gt; #include &lt;vector&gt; std::vector&lt;std::string&gt; a{&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;}; for (auto s : a) // s has type `std::string` { std::cout &lt;&lt; s &lt;&lt; std::endl; } Note how Rust makes it crystal clear that copying during iteration and using String for instead of &amp;str for static strings are an anti-pattern and how C++ makes it easy to write such inefficient code. 1.4.4 goto Statement and Breaking outer Loops Rust, like Java and Python, allows you to break an outer loop from an inner loop: for i in 0..3 { &#39;for_j: for j in 0..3 { for k in 0..3 { if i == 1 { break &#39;for_j; } println!(&quot;{} {} {}&quot;, i, j, k); } } } C++ doesn’t support this natively, so people are using goto to achieve this: #include &lt;iostream&gt; printf(&quot;Break outer loop using goto:\\n&quot;); for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; ++i) { for (int j = 0; j &lt; 3; ++j) { for (int k = 0; k &lt; 3; ++k) { if (i == 1) { goto the_end; } std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;i: &quot; &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; &quot; j: &quot; &lt;&lt; j &lt;&lt; &quot; k &quot; &lt;&lt; k &lt;&lt; std::endl; } } the_end: { } } Using goto sounds like I am joking. I’m not. People really suggests doing this2. It’s a consensus that goto statements are error-prone, but there really aren’t better ways to do this when you absolutely need to break an outer loop. The C++ committee never solves really problems. Alternatively you can use a flag, which is more verbose, and I think this is even less readable: printf(&quot;Break outer loop using flag:\\n&quot;); bool i_is_1{false}; for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; ++i) { for (int j = 0; j &lt; 3; ++j) { for (int k = 0; k &lt; 3; ++k) { if (i == 1) { i_is_1 = true; break; } else { i_is_1 = false; } std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;i: &quot; &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; &quot; j: &quot; &lt;&lt; j &lt;&lt; &quot; k &quot; &lt;&lt; k &lt;&lt; std::endl; } if (i_is_1) { break; } } } There is another cleaner way, using the lambda trick (but why the hell must I use a lamba for such a basic task???): printf(&quot;Break outer loop using lambda:\\n&quot;); for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; ++i) { [&amp;] { for (int j = 0; j &lt; 3; ++j) { for (int k = 0; k &lt; 3; ++k) { if (i == 1) { return; } std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;i: &quot; &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; &quot; j: &quot; &lt;&lt; j &lt;&lt; &quot; k &quot; &lt;&lt; k &lt;&lt; std::endl; } } }(); } I’ll get back to lamdas later. For now just accept that they are roughly equivalent to Rust’s closures.
